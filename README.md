# Orthopneumovirus Comparison

This workflow compares the distances between human and bovine RSV for each gene. 
It downloads RSV-A, RSV-B and bovine sequences from NCBI GenBank and outputs a graph with
distances between clades in each group. 

### Running the Workflow

To run the workflow, run 'snakemake --cores all' from the command line.
